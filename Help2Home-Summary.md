# Help2Home Summary

Help2Home is a rent\-financing and property marketplace platform that makes housing accessible for people who can afford rent *monthly* but struggle to pay the full year upfront\. 

We partner with property owners and financial institutions to offer both outright and installment payment options\. 

Tenants can choose a home, pay a 50% down payment, and spread the balance monthly, while landlords get paid upfront\.

Beyond rentals, Help2Home also enables buying and selling of properties, installment sales, and short\-let bookings, creating a full real\-estate ecosystem on one platform\.

We make money through interest on financed rent, service charges, property listing fees, agency and legal fees, investor\-backed rent funding, and revenue from short\-lets and property sales\.

Our goal is simple: remove the financial barrier to quality housing, help landlords earn more reliably, and create a safer, structured, tech\-driven rental system in Nigeria\. Help2Home is where flexible rent meets real estate innovation\.

**The Problem and the Vision**

Every year, millions of Nigerians struggle to pay their annual rent upfront\. Most landlords demand one or two years’ rent in advance, putting tenants under huge financial pressure\. Many people take high\-interest loans, sell personal belongings, or even face eviction because they cannot afford lump\-sum payments\.

On the other side, landlords worry about delayed payments, bad tenants, and defaults\. 

Financial institutions find it difficult to reach reliable tenants, and investors miss out on a massive housing opportunity\. The system is outdated, stressful, and unfair to everyone\.

**Help2Home** is changing that story\.

Help2Home is a smart digital platform that makes renting easier, safer, and more flexible by allowing tenants to pay rent **in installments**—monthly or quarterly—while ensuring landlords receive their full rent upfront\. It connects tenants, landlords, financial institutions, legal services, and investors into one trusted housing ecosystem\.

Our goal is simple: **to make rent simple, smart, and secure for everyone\.**

**How Help2Home Works**

1. A tenant finds or lists a home through the Help2Home app or website\.
2. The tenant applies to pay rent in installments\.
3. Help2Home and its partner financial institutions verify the tenant’s affordability, credit score, and background\.
4. Once approved, the financial partner pays the landlord the **full annual rent upfront**\.
5. The tenant then repays the amount monthly or quarterly to Help2Home through the platform\.
6. Legal contracts, insurance, and all records are securely managed online\.

This system ensures that landlords receive full payment without waiting, tenants enjoy flexibility, and financial institutions and investors earn stable, low\-risk returns\.

**Core Services**

Help2Home is more than just an installment rent platform — it is a complete housing finance and management solution\.

**1\. Rent Payment in Installments**

Tenants can spread their rent payments monthly or quarterly instead of paying all at once\. This reduces financial stress and increases affordability\.

**2\. Rent Protection Insurance**

In partnership with insurance firms, we protect landlords and tenants in cases of job loss, illness, or death\. This ensures landlords still receive payment and tenants have peace of mind\.

**3\. Legal Contract Management**

All rental agreements are legally binding, transparent, and created through verified legal partners\. This eliminates fraud and misunderstanding between parties\.

**4\. Credit Scoring and Verification**

Help2Home uses technology to verify tenant credibility, financial ability, and payment history\. Reliable tenants get better terms over time\.

**5\. Property Listing and Management Portal**

Landlords and agents can list verified properties, manage tenants, and track payments on our platform\.
